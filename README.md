# journal_recorder
An NLP api for mobile app for journal recordings.


Business case :

The daily journal recorder app can be a valuable tool for individuals and organizations looking to better understand and analyze their thoughts, emotions, and experiences. There is a growing demand for self-care and mental health tools, and this app can help individuals in these areas by providing a platform to record and analyze their journal entries.

One potential monetization strategy for the app would be to offer a subscription-based model. Users would pay a monthly or annual fee for access to the app's features and storage. This model would provide a steady stream of revenue and would be appealing to individuals looking for a comprehensive journaling solution.

Here is a step-by-step guide for the development of your daily journal recorder app:

    Research and Development of Speech Recognition and NLP Technologies:
        Conduct a thorough research on existing speech recognition and NLP technologies, and select the most suitable ones for your app.
        Test and evaluate the selected technologies to ensure they meet the requirements and performance expectations for your app.

    Development of Frontend User Interface:
        Design and develop the user interface for the app, including the recording and viewing functionality.
        Implement the voice recognition technology to detect the starting and ending statements of a journal entry.
        Develop the audio recording functionality using the device's microphone.

    Development of Backend Processing and Storage Functionality:
        Implement the automatic speech recognition technology to convert audio to text.
        Develop the NLP algorithms for summarization, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.
        Choose and set up a database or file system for storing processed journal entries.
        Develop APIs to access journal entries and processing results.

    Integration and Testing:
        Integrate the frontend and backend components of the app.
        Test the app thoroughly to ensure all functionality is working as expected and resolve any bugs or issues found.

    Deployment and Maintenance:
        Deploy the app to a suitable platform (e.g. App Store, Google Play Store) for distribution to users.
        Provide ongoing maintenance and support to ensure the app remains up-to-date and functional.

Note: This is a high-level guide, and the actual steps and process may vary based on the specific technologies and tools used. It's also important to have a clear project plan with defined milestones and deadlines, as well as a dedicated team with the necessary skills and expertise to carry out the project.
